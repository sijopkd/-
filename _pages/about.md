### Hello! 

I am Sijo, a Master of Science in Business Analytics student at the McCombs School of Business, the University of Texas at Austin. 
At UT Austin, I am in the pursuit of becoming a data-driven storyteller. Before joining UT Austin, I worked as a Consultant at the Data Science & 
Analytics division of Capgemini. I am a Mechanical Engineer graduated from BITS-Pilani(2012 - 2016) and I hail from the God's Own Country in India, Kerala!  

I have been playing tennis since April 2007 and I am a huge fan of Rafael Nadal. Recently, I started running long distances and ran in several 
running events, mostly 5k runs. As a person interested in both sports and data, I participate in fantasy competitions online - fantasy premier league 
is my favorite. 

I started this blog for my personal reference and also as an initiative to communicate my interesting analyses. If you want to discuss analytics, 
sports, or fitness, connect with me!
